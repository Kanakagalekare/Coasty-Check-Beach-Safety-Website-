#The Coasty Check System

The Coasty Check System uses the INCOIS (Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services) API to provide tourists with current beach safety information. 
The system guarantees that tourists receive timely updates by retrieving data on tsunami warnings, storm surges, high wave alerts, swell surges, ocean currents, and water quality parameters, 
including temperature, pH, salinity, and CDOM. 
Data is extracted and processed using Postman, and real-time values are compared against safety thresholds to assess risk levels.
Tourists can access this information through a user-friendly mobile app that displays a color-coded pin system indicating beach safety status: Red for high risk, Orange for moderate risk, 
Yellow for low risk, and Green for safe conditions. The app provides accurate oceanic parameters and water quality data through an interactive interface and includes features such as 5-day 
forecasts and tidal status updates to help tourists plan their visits effectively.
